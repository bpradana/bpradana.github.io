			<strong>tl;dr:</strong>
			Only buy AirPods if you have multiple Apple devices. Otherwise, don&#39;t bother.

		<section class="body">
			<p>A couple of days ago, my impulse buying habit kicked in and I bought the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation. I&rsquo;ve been using it for a few days now, and I have some thoughts about it.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="spatial-audio">Spatial Audio</h3>
<p>The spatial audio feature is, shockingly, amazing. It feels like the sound is coming from all around you—like having a home theater crammed into your ears. I listened to &ldquo;Ceilings&rdquo; by Lizzy McAlpine (Dolby Atmos) on Apple Music, and it was an immersive experience. Instruments actually feel like they&rsquo;re coming from the ceiling (pun painfully intended), especially with the head-tracking feature turned on.</p>
<h3 id="transparency-mode">Transparency Mode</h3>
<p>The transparency mode is a game-changer. It&rsquo;s so natural that sometimes I forget I&rsquo;m wearing the AirPods. With the transparency volume cranked up in the accessibility settings, it&rsquo;s like having super hearing. I can hear even the faintest sound around me. Perfect for eavesdropping on people (just kidding&hellip; sort of).</p>
<h3 id="seamless-integration">Seamless Integration</h3>
<p>I constantly switch between my phone and my laptop, and the AirPods make it so easy. For example, if I&rsquo;m listening music on my laptop and then decide to watch a cat video on my phone, the AirPods automatically switch to my phone. It&rsquo;s like magic. No more fiddling around with settings. It just works. (p.s. I hate saying iPhone and MacBook, so I&rsquo;m just going to say phone and laptop)</p>
<h3 id="case-with-speaker">Case with Speaker</h3>
<p>Being the clumsy person that I am, I constantly misplace things. The case having a speaker is a godsend. I can just play a sound from the FindMy app, and the case will make a noise. It’s saved me from tearing the house apart on more than one occasion.</p>
<h3 id="adaptive-sound">Adaptive Sound</h3>
<p>Apple has pulled off some black magic fuckery with their adaptive sound feature. The AirPods automatically adjust—wait for it—<strong>SPECIFIC SOUND VOLUME</strong>. I was at a friend&rsquo;s place, and he was blasting music like it was the end of the world. I turned on adaptive sound, and his music’s volume magically lowered, but I could still hear my friends talking.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<h3 id="glossy-case">Glossy Case</h3>
<p>The case is glossy, and it’s an absolute nightmare. It&rsquo;s a fingerprint magnet. It&rsquo;s a scratch magnet. I hate it. I wish it was matte. I wish it was anything but glossy white. It&rsquo;s as if Apple wants me to suffer by showcasing every single scratches.</p>
<h3 id="no-precision-finding">No Precision Finding</h3>
<p>Apple disabled the Precision Finding feature in Indonesia. I can&rsquo;t use the FindMy app to locate my AirPods with augmented reality. I paid a fortune for a phone with a U2 chip and AirPods with a U1 chip only to find out ultra-wideband is not available in my beloved country, Indonesia 🇮🇩. Thanks, Apple, for keeping my expectations high and then shattering them.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<h3 id="the-price">The Price</h3>
<p>The price is absurd. I shelled out $220 for these. I could&rsquo;ve bought a decent pair of headphones for that amount. But of course, I bought them anyway because I&rsquo;m a sheep. I follow the trends. I&rsquo;m a slave to Apple. I&rsquo;m a fool.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you have multiple Apple devices and some cash to burn, the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation is a no-brainer. The seamless integration alone is worth the price. If you don&rsquo;t have multiple Apple devices, don&rsquo;t bother. There are better options out there for less money. But if you’re like me and can’t resist the Apple ecosystem, welcome to the club of financially irresponsible fools.</p>
