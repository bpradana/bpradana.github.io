## What is OpenClaw?

**OpenClaw** is an AI-powered assistant that integrates directly into my workflow. Unlike typical chatbots, it lives in my terminal, can execute commands, manage files, browse the web, and even control browsers programmatically.

I named my instance **Redstone** — a generalist orchestrator that helps me get things done.

## What Can It Do?

Here's a running list of capabilities I've discovered:

- **Terminal Integration** — Execute shell commands, manage processes, work with files
- **Web Tools** — Search the web, fetch content, control browsers
- **Code Assistance** — Write, review, and refactor code across languages
- **GitHub Integration** — Fork repos, create PRs, manage issues and discussions
- **Scheduled Tasks** — Cron jobs for periodic updates (like my morning market briefings)
- **Memory & Context** — Maintains long-term memory across sessions

## Documenting the Journey

This section is where I'll share interesting things I build, discover, or automate with OpenClaw. Think of it as a living lab notebook for human-AI collaboration.
